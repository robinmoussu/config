	 <Text>Composing the ambient exploration tracks definitely ended up being the weirdest part of creating music for Gone Home.</Text>
	</subtitle>
	<subtitle id="1">
    <StartTime>6</StartTime>
    <Text>The audio diaries tended to take precedence since they had such clear criteria for completion, so the ambient tracks were the last things I did.</Text>
	</subtitle>
	<subtitle id="2">
	 <StartTime>13</StartTime>
	 <Text> I spent so long immersed in the logs which were very specifically timed, that to suddenly shift gears to creating these slow standalone five-minute pieces was surprisingly difficult.</Text>
	</subtitle>
	<subtitle id="3">
    <StartTime>21</StartTime>
    <Text>I remember giving Steve a first stab at the ambient track for part 2 of the game, and I didn’t hear anything back about it.</Text>
	</subtitle>
	<subtitle id="4">
    <StartTime>27</StartTime>
    <Text>When I eventually asked if he had any feedback, he said something like, "Oh yeah, it’s great, I just slowed it down by 50 percent and it totally works,"</Text>
	</subtitle>
	<subtitle id="4">
    <StartTime>32</StartTime>
    <Text>which cracked me up, because I definitely didn’t have that in mind.</Text>
	</subtitle>
	<subtitle id="5">
    <StartTime>37</StartTime>
    <Text>But that’s one of the great things about collaborative work, so I just went with it.</Text>
	</subtitle>
	<subtitle id="6">
    <StartTime>40</StartTime>
    <Text>I ended up doing a number of further revisions, where I’d alter elements of the original version, specifically to affect how the 50 percent slowed version would sound.</Text>
	</subtitle>
	<subtitle id="7">
    <StartTime>48</StartTime>
    <Text>It was definitely a new experience for me, writing bits of music and trying to imagine how they would sound after it's been considerably distorted.</Text>
	</subtitle>
	<subtitle id="7">
    <StartTime>54</StartTime>
    <Text> It got weirder though. The ambient track for part 1 ended up being a backwards version of the slowed down part 2 track.</Text>
	</subtitle>
	<subtitle id="7">
    <StartTime>59</StartTime>
    <Text>And again there were elements that sounded good at 50 percent slow forwards but not at 50 percent slow backwards,</Text>
	</subtitle>
		<subtitle id="7">
    <StartTime>65</StartTime>
    <Text>so again I went back to the original track and started altering elements so they would sound better at half speed in reverse.</Text>
	</subtitle>
	<subtitle id="7">
    <StartTime>71</StartTime>
    <Text>I don’t know if that’s a thing that ambient composers end up getting used to, but for me it definitely felt like going down the rabbit hole.</Text>

    <Text>Karla: Most of the bookshelves in the house are filled with undifferentiated books, I mean, they’re not undifferentiated but they’re low detail, because, god,</Text>

    <Text>it would be an entire dev cycle’s worth of work to actually do plausible spines on every single book - that would kill us. And then to repeat a whole bunch of books would also be sort of terrible and not be very plausible.</Text>

    <Text>So we had chiefly unlabeled books, or books in which the labels had been rubbed off due to age, etc, and we had a few individual books that were more precisely and specifically named.</Text>

    <Text>in different bookshelves in the house so that hopefully, I think, every bookshelf has a least one unique book in it though that might not be true of everything in the library</Text>

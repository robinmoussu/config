    <Text>So that was probably the hardest one we had to record. It was actually part of the second batch of recording we did, so I had the script a few days before we did the recording, to kind of read through it all and get a feel for where the story was going,</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>24</StartTime>
    <Text>and then we’d met for lunch to go over everything and see if I had any questions before we went into the studio. And I just right away admitted, yep, some part of this script here like, yep I will be honest, one of these totally had me crying.</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>38</StartTime>
    <Text>Like, straight up, totally couldn’t help it. Figuring like, yeah, I had my cry out, it was good, I’ll be fine, get to the recording, it’ll be great. Ya know, get it out of your system.</Text>
  </subtitle>
   <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>49</StartTime>
    <Text>And as soon as like I read the first word, I was like, no, oh god, I’m gonna start crying again, this is gonna be great. Like hey, I’m a professional voice actress in the studio, I’m gonna totally bawl all over your lines</Text>
  </subtitle>
   <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>60</StartTime>
    <Text>and it’s going to sound ridiculous and terrible, and we’re going to have to do the take again, and it’s gonna sound even worse because now I’m crying…</Text>

  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>67</StartTime>
    <Text>So, it actually ended up being one take. Really… cathartic in a way, for me, I think. Because it’s, it’s really… How do I put it…</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>84</StartTime>
    <Text>It’s really me talking to… like, specific people.</Text>
  </subtitle>
   <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>94</StartTime>
    <Text>I knew it was going to happen again, I knew it, I knew it! It’s this stupid writing being so on-point!</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>100</StartTime>
    <Text>Which is a great, I mean, you know, definite praise for the character buildup at this point, because I just become so connected with her, and making those parallels all the way along, and then you get to this point where it’s like, I know exactly how you feel. Like, I know exactly what you’re going through.</Text>

  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>125</StartTime>
    <Text>I mean it was just, it was completely authentic. I mean, I’ve enjoyed people commenting on the connection they’ve had to the emotion that’s in the character, and this is always the diary I think of, because it’s the one that most got me.

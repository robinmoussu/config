    <Text>Which was great, because I’d watched them all when they were actually on, it was one of those favorite shows my sister and I would sit down and watch every week. And so going back and watching them was definitely not a hard chore to have to do.</Text>

    <Text>So I basically went through all of the episodes I could find online in a couple of days, so it was a bit of a sudden binge watch of My So-Called Life.</Text>

    <Text>But it was great, because I think watching My So-Called Life was a nice reminder of what a more natural presentation of a teenager is. So it was really… I don’t know if it would have gone as well had I not done that.</Text>

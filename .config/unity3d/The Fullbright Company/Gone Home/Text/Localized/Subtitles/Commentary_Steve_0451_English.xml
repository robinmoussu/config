    <Text>and it’s 0451 which is a bit of tradition slash in-joke amongst... I mean it’s not really an in-joke it’s just an internal reference amongst</Text>

    <Text>this lineage of games that hark back to immersive sims that are kind of first person exploration games that started with Ultima Underworld and System Shock,</Text>
  </subtitle>
	<subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>40.5</StartTime>
    <Text> and 451 was the first key code in System Shock and then it was also the first key code in System Shock 2 and Deus Ex and BioShock</Text>

    <Text>this writing, breaking canon, is in Emily’s handwriting - Emily’s handwriting is technically only in the font that exists outside the game,</Text>
  </subtitle>
  	<subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>111.7</StartTime>

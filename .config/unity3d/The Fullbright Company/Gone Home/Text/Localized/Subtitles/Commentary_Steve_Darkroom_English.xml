    <Text>It’s one of those things where we had always wanted to,</Text>
  </subtitle>
    <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>4.6</StartTime>
    <Text>well a) we wanted to pay off Sam’s darkroom by letting you go in it and see photos that she had taken,</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>12.3</StartTime>
    <Text>and b) this started from a point of me just being like, oh we’ll just end the game the same way we ended Minerva’s Den, it’ll be fine,</Text>
  </subtitle>
	<subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>24.5</StartTime>
    <Text>but between those two things we initially figured we were signing up for photos that would’ve taken a lot of time and effort to make, of like,</Text>
  </subtitle>
	<subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>37.6</StartTime>
    <Text>a photo strip of the two of them in a photo booth which would mean like, let’s do four pairs of you know, photo painted photos of these characters-</Text>

    <Text>Karla: Oh god.</Text>
  </subtitle>
  	<subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>48.2</StartTime>
    <Text>Steve: And you know, just like pictures of them in the mirror together and all of this very high cost facial rendering, basically, for Karla to do,</Text>
  </subtitle>
  	<subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>59.8</StartTime>
    <Text>because we had this style that was like okay, you do photo collage and then you paint it over to make it look consistent</Text>
  </subtitle>
    <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>67.5</StartTime>
    <Text>and it’s a lot of work and it’s hard to get the pieces and the lighting and the poses and everything looking right.</Text>
  </subtitle>
    <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>71</StartTime>
    <Text>Karla: I’m just not that much of a pro in order to be able to do it that fast, and so, yeah it would’ve been months.</Text>
  </subtitle>
    <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>77</StartTime>
    <Text>Steve: So we have the one very close up photo of Lonnie’s eye and then we just brainstormed what are evocative images of the two of them</Text>
  </subtitle>
    <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>88</StartTime>
    <Text>and their life that we could create without having to show their faces a bunch.</Text>
  </subtitle>
    <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>95</StartTime>
    <Text>And I think that, like so many things, taking a step back and only seeing the implication of these characters is probably a lot more powerful than if we had just made a bunch of pictures of them looking at the camera.</Text>
  </subtitle>
    <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>109</StartTime>
    <Text>Karla: Being less literal is definitely more meaningful in this particular case, to the extent that I remember when I took these holding hands photos with Rachel-</Text>
  </subtitle>
    <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>121</StartTime>
    <Text>I don’t know, I took, twenty, a dozen, something like that, different versions of them and then I was going through them afterward</Text>
  </subtitle>
    <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>129</StartTime>
    <Text> to try and find the one that I wanted to use to Photoshop and add letters on the heart and everything,</Text>
  </subtitle>
    <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>135</StartTime>
    <Text>and I found myself thinking, aw these are all so sweet, and like, I had just taken them ten minutes ago with my roommate</Text>
  </subtitle>
    <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>143</StartTime>
    <Text>and it was just like, somehow this here is more evocative and meaningful than a happy face, I guess.</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>153</StartTime>
    <Text>But anyways, yeah, I was fooled by my own schtick which is extremely silly.</Text>

    <Text>Steve: Really early on I thought it would be, like - something that I thought would be engaging about Gone Home would just be finding notes and scraps in unexpected places</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>15</StartTime>
    <Text>and being able to zoom in really far and find something that’s tucked away in someone’s pocket or whatever and yeah, finding a note that was in someone’s pocket that had gone through the dryer,</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>24</StartTime>
    <Text>I thought, would just be a cool image. So we were always going to do this and we ended up making it this specific note from Lonnie to Sam, which it wasn’t this for a long time -</Text>

    <Text>Karla: Yeah, we had a few different go rounds.</Text>

    <Text>Steve: The one that’s in the garbage can in the garage was here for a long time and this one didn’t exist and there was no note in the garbage can in the garage.</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>52</StartTime>
    <Text>But yeah I think that this note - this is, I think, the last note that went into the game.</Text>

    <Text>Karla: It was really late.</Text>

    <Text>Steve: And - like the last new content that went into the game. Because we did our final pre-release playtest and there were people that were kind of like, “I felt like Lonnie’s decision came out of nowhere at the end,”</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>74</StartTime>
    <Text>and I was like, why is that, and I think it’s because Lonnie had never gotten to say her piece, and never gotten to have that moment of saying, I wish things were different and I want to be with you and I don’t want to have to go away,</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>91</StartTime>
    <Text>but we’ve just made the assumption that that’s how it’s got to be. To give you some context for her when she actually had to confront it saying, I can’t live with it being that way. And so this was her chance to speak just from her own perspective</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>108</StartTime>
    <Text>about why she felt like she had no choice in the matter, and then what she was deciding against when she changed her mind, when she finally had to ship out.</Text>

    <Text>Sam and Lonnie got caught together and Lonnie's dad was an asshole about it,</Text>

    <StartTime>18</StartTime>
    <Text>and threatened to send Lonnie to live with her mom in Florida.</Text>

    <Text>Karla: Yeah, that was why I was kidding you.</Text>

    <Text>Steve: So, yes, the reason I think that Lonnie's mom lives in Florida is that I grew up in Florida, and I moved from Florida to Oregon when I was like 19, and... I've been back to visit, but you know.</Text>

  </subtitle>
	<subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>90.5</StartTime>
    <Text>I would take a sheet of notebook paper, and I would write NO on it as big as you can get...

  </subtitle>
    	<subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>124</StartTime>
    <Text>and we went around Christmas, so I remember hearing on the radio multiple times, dogs barking Christmas carols. That's Florida.</Text>

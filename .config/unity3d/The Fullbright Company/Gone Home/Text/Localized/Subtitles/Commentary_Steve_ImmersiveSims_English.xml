    <Text>A lot of Gone Home is about pointless interactivity, that is sort of things being interactive for the sake of them being interactive,</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>9</StartTime>
    <Text>but it really comes from our inspirations of immersive sims, like System Shock and BioShock and Thief, where a big part of the design philosophy behind those games,</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>24.5</StartTime>
    <Text>and Gone Home, is that the world needs to be really internally consistent, and there's this feeling that if there's something that your character might do, you should be able to do it in the game.</Text>

  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>36</StartTime>
    <Text>So in BioShock, for instance, you can flush all the toilets and you can turn on all the faucets and that's also true in Deus Ex and Dishonored.</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>47</StartTime>
    <Text>And sometimes like the water fountains in Deus Ex give you one health or whatever, but really, you can interact with them because there's this expectation of,</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>55</StartTime>
    <Text>if you could interact with that if you encountered it in this world, we should let you do that, right?</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>61</StartTime>
    <Text>So all of the faucets in our game can be turned on, and they are just, they can be turned on so that you can turn them on, and you can flush all the toilets,</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>71</StartTime>
    <Text>and it extends into our philosophy behind, you can pick up every plastic cup and toothbrush and kleenex box,</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>78.5</StartTime>
    <Text>not because it's going to add a whole lot to your understanding of this world to be able to look at the underside of a cup,</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>87</StartTime>
    <Text>but to pay off that expectation and say to the player, "Yeah, you could pick that up and look at it, so we're going to let you do that,</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>95</StartTime>
    <Text>and it's going to be consistent interactively with the stuff that IS important,</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>100</StartTime>
    <Text>and that makes it your job to look at everything and give it your attention and for you to decide and understand and figure out what has significance and what doesn't, and not for us to tell that to you."</Text>

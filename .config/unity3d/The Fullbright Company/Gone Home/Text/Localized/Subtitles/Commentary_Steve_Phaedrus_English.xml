    <Text>I was one of the hosts of the Idle Thumbs video game podcast for a year or two, and I go on there every once in a while, those guys are my friends.</Text>

  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>11</StartTime>
    <Text>And I didn't want to put Idle Thumbs references all over the game, but I did want to have Idle Thumbs references in the game, so we localized them entirely to this one piece of paper.</Text>

  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>24</StartTime>
    <Text>So almost everything on here is an Idle Thumbs reference, and specifically to a weird exchange that we had about Will Wright's GDC talk in... 2008?</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>37</StartTime>
    <Text>Where he didn't want everybody to show up and crowd the place, so he gave his speaker name as Phaedrus, and then did a talk about a bunch of crazy stuff, including the idea of rocket mail,</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>49</StartTime>
    <Text>which was gonna be done by... it was pitched by the US Postal Service in the 50s and stuff, and so...</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>57</StartTime>
    <Text>The thing on the podcast was about how Phaedrus had a little brother, and so... anyway, whatever, the Brother, "Of course it's a Phaedrus!",</Text>

  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>64</StartTime>
    <Text>and you can't hardly see the icon on the back 'cause it's obscured, but there's this 50s rocket icon on the back that's the logo of Phaedrus Motors.</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>75</StartTime>
    <Text>And then also, it's a, the reference that Will Wright was making, and that is a secondary reference here because of the motorcycle thing,</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>82.5</StartTime>
    <Text>is that in "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance", the book, the author is having kind of an ongoing exchange with this character from Greek history called Phaedrus, and motorcycles, and blah blah blah.</Text>

  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>98</StartTime>
    <Text>So it's a big knot of obnoxious references to lots of different stupid things.</Text>

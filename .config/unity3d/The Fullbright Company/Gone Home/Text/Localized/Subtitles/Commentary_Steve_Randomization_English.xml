    <Text>Steve: Almost none of the events, the little events in the game are scripted, as far as like, triggering when you do something specific.</Text>

    <Text>So all of the thunder and lightning, and the creaky noises in the house, they're all just randomized on timers,</Text>

    <Text>the only _scripted_ scripted thing is in the secret passageway, when you look at the crucifix, there's scripting that detects that you did that and then it causes the light to pop,</Text>

    <Text>which is my one indulgence of messing with the player.</Text>

    <Text>But we've had a lot of people play the game and say, "Oh, the way that you scripted it so that when I walked into the TV room there was that big thunder and lightning strike, that was really spooky!"</Text>

  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>55</StartTime>
    <Text>or, "I walked through that one door and then you played that sound behind me,"</Text>

  </subtitle>
    <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>71</StartTime>
    <Text>and the randomization of stuff can make it seem like the random elements have extra significance to them, but in fact, you just got lucky, basically.</Text>

    <Text>Karla: Yeah, it's total apophenia, 'cause, it's just, there's enough random things going on, and you can do enough things, that eventually some of them are going to line up. Which is, you know, cool!</Text>

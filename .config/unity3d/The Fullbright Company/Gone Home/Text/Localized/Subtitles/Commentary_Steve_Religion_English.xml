    <Text>Steve: Mom and dad are much more actively religious - you know, there's a bible in the foyer, and there's a bible in dad's bedside table...</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>10.5</StartTime>
    <Text>Karla: Well, or arguably they want to appear actively religious. But yes.</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>15</StartTime>
    <Text>Steve: Yeah, I think that... I mean, my intent was that they aren't super-religious, but they probably still go to church.</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>22</StartTime>
    <Text>Karla: And they would also probably - they would feel bad if they put their bibles away, they'd be like, "Aww, we need those to be out for us to look at. To consult, in case we need them," or something.</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>31</StartTime>
    <Text>Steve: But it's definitely - I don't know, it comes from my own experience, of my parents went to church, and were more religious and stuff, and around when I was like 10 or 12 or something,</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>43</StartTime>
    <Text>I remember having a conscious realization that, "None of this makes any sense! This is all about a guy who was dead and then came back from the dead! That doesn't happen! Magic isn't real!"
	 Karla: Wow.</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>59</StartTime>
    <Text>Steve: And then there was a process of just being like, "OK, well, I'm just not going to go to church." </Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>66</StartTime>
    <Text>I also remember having a conscious realization that the only reason that I wanted to go to church was because after the service they gave you free doughnuts.</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>72.5</StartTime>
    <Text>Karla: Oh yeah, well, that's fine.</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>76</StartTime>
    <Text>Steve: So, I don't know, it's probably just partially me projecting and trying to show that Sam is re-examining her own values as she gets older and grows out of childhood</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>88</StartTime>
    <Text>and doesn't necessarily share the same beliefs that her parents do.</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>93</StartTime>
    <Text>Karla: I never tried really hard to, like... I don't know, actually, it was normal church behavior, I would go and help out with my younger siblings,</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>105</StartTime>
    <Text>and my parents always went to church and whatever and I would go along, and there was a couple of people I knew there.</Text>
  </subtitle>
    <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>111</StartTime>
    <Text>But it took me until, I think I was like 13 or 14, and I spent a significant amount of time really trying to be like, "All right, I'm going to do this church thing. I'm going to try really hard!"</Text>
  </subtitle>
    <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>123</StartTime>
    <Text>and I would get annoyed at people when they said "Oh my god" and stuff, because I thought that was what you were supposed to do,</Text>
  </subtitle>
    <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>131</StartTime>
    <Text>and that lasted like, I don't know, 6 or 8 months or something, and then it broke, and I couldn't do it any more.</Text>
  </subtitle>
    <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>138</StartTime>
    <Text>I forget what.. I did something, I ruined something in the church through total not caring... I built, I remember now, I built a house of cards out of a bible trivia...</Text>
  </subtitle>
    <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>156</StartTime>
    <Text>Steve: Like flashcard set?
Karla: ...set. Well, it was just like Trivial Pursuit except it was bible-based. And I built this big house of cards,</Text>
  </subtitle>
      <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>164</StartTime>
    <Text>and at one point I remember thinking, "All right, you know what, fuck it," and I glued the cards into place,</Text>
  </subtitle>
    <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>170</StartTime>
    <Text>so I have this big house of cards all glued together, totally ruining all the goddamn cards, and at that point I stopped having to go to church so much.</Text>

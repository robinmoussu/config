    <Text>Steve: So there's a lot less density in the house than there would be in a real house, like if you look around your house there's just junk piled everywhere, probably.</Text>

    <Text>Karla: Maybe that's just our house?
	 Steve: I think it's most house.
	Karla: Oh, you're right.</Text>

    <Text>Steve: But so our strategy was, you either fully invest in something, and put a plausible representation of this aspect of a room in, or you just don't put it in at all.</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>25</StartTime>
    <Text>And the player will fill in the gaps between, "Oh, these are all the things that represent the kind of room I'm supposed to be in, and it doesn't jump out at me that there's no toilet plungers in the bathroom," or whatever.</Text>

  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>34.5</StartTime>
    <Text>But the biggest instance of this, that I think actually totally works, because no one has ever called it out, is, surprise, think about it, there are no shoes in this house! Da da!</Text>

    <Text>Karla: Where's your brain now?
	 Steve: And I don't think anybody's noticed it, and I think it's because... </Text>

  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>52</StartTime>
    <Text> if we had put one pair of shoes, or two pairs of shoes, people would have said, "Where are all the rest of the shoes?"</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>57.2</StartTime>
    <Text>But really to have a plausible house, mom would have to have ten pairs of shoes, and her work boots, and dad would need to have some tennis shoes, and some work shoes, and so on and so forth,</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>66</StartTime>
    <Text>so we just said "There aren't going to be any shoes", and we hope nobody notices.</Text>

    <Text>Steve: The fact that there are speedruns for our game makes me really happy, and the fact that the</Text>

    <Text>"any-percent" speedrun, A.K.A. you don't have to pick up anything, just get to the end as fast as possible, has basically been optimized to, I think, 47 or 48 seconds?</Text>

    <Text>Even just watching that speedrun is really fun because you see the player optimize like...</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>23.5</StartTime>
    <Text>for instance, the fastest speedruns, they don't turn on any lights, because it would take a fraction of a second to turn towards the lightswitch and turn it on, and then turn back to the direction that they wanted to go,</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>36.5</StartTime>
    <Text>and they just kind of strafe past things and don't even change direction to move through the house.</Text>

  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>43</StartTime>
    <Text>And yeah, the 100 percent diary speedrun is even more interesting because players use that secret knowledge to play the game totally out-of-order,</Text>

    <Text>based on a strategy for "OK, what's the most efficient way to go to these 24 points in the game?"</Text>

    <Text>Karla: Like spatially. So it's like the salesman problem, or something, where it has to go to all these different points, and what's the best way to do it? It's cool.</Text>

    <Text>Steve: Yeah, so seeing someone think about the house in a totally different way, in a strategic way that is about this player-created challenge that says,</Text>

    <StartTime>82.5</StartTime>
    <Text>"Oh, OK, if I go into the basement first, then back out, and into the east wing, then don't even go into the west wing until after..." you know, and all that kind of stuff?</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>92</StartTime>
    <Text>It's really cool to see that stuff evolve, and I'm really glad that we didn't make it so, for instance, you had to read the note about the secret door before you could even click on the secret door,</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>106</StartTime>
    <Text>because it would have shut down so many of those opportunities for people to play in interesting ways and express their mastery over the space that they've gained by playing the game.</Text>

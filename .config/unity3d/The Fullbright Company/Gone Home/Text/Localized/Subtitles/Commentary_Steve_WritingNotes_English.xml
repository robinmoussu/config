    <Text>Barfburger is enjoyed by all.</Text>

    <Text>So the thing is, I drew the Barfburger, because I drew all of Lonnie's drawings, so I drew the two cats on the motorcycle,</Text>

  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>17</StartTime>
    <Text>and, yeah, the Captain Allegra drawings, and stuff like that.</Text>

    <Text>That was really, I think that, it goes hand-in-hand with...</Text>

    <Text>and so being able to just quickly rewrite a note that we wanted to change, and scan it and update the game,</Text>

    <StartTime>45</StartTime>

    <Text>And also we both just happened to have sloppy teenager handwriting that looks believably 17 years old.</Text>

  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>77</StartTime>
    <Text>where I would write my part of the note and then hand the piece of paper to Karla, and she would write her part of the note. We just constructed it that way.</Text>

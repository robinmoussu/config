    <Text>Steve: Writing Sam was a unique challenge. Just in the sense of - On the one hand it was very much from my personal experience because it's about being a teenager,</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>18</StartTime>
    <Text>and my memories from that time, you know, as an individual, but also who Sam was and what her experience was, came about as a result of kind of problem solving that we were doing - that Karla and I were doing -</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>41</StartTime>
    <Text>just figuring out what the story and what the conflict in the story was going to be.</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>46.5</StartTime>
    <Text>So by the time we figured out this was all going to take place in one house, and that the conflict was going to be between the members of this family,</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>54</StartTime>
    <Text>and it had to be kind of irreconcilable differences that would cause serious drama between the members of this family, you know, we started thinking, what form could that take?</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>68</StartTime>
    <Text>Could it be that the teenager of the family falls in love with somebody that they're not supposed to, and the parents don't agree, and what is the contemporary version of that?</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>78.5</StartTime>
    <Text>And so, you know, we... at some point decided that we were going to write Sam as a gay character who had fallen in love with another girl and what conflict would that cause within the family, right?</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>91.5</StartTime>
    <Text>Karla: And we were excited about that opportunity just because of the paucity of that kind of narrative in games,</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>101</StartTime>
    <Text>and I remember when we came up with that concept just being like "Oh man this is going to be good if we actually get to do this!"</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>108</StartTime>
    <Text>Which is really cool. But anyway we actually, yeah, we had to do a lot of work to make it plausible.</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>115</StartTime>
    <Text>Steve: Right, because the other side of it is that, I'm the writer on the game, and on the one hand a lot of teenage experience is universal,</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>127</StartTime>
    <Text>but I also at some point just had that very clear realization of, "OK, I have just signed up for writing a gay teenage girl, two out of the three aspects of that character are not something that I've actually lived through."</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>143</StartTime>
    <Text>And so it was impressed upon me, especially when I was working at Irrational, how important research was to getting your fiction right,</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>154.5</StartTime>
    <Text>whether it's very practical terms, like how something works mechanically, to what the characterization of the individuals in your story might be.</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>164</StartTime>
    <Text>So my process was reading a lot of blogs about people's actual experiences growing up being gay and being female, and reading fiction and non-fiction about people's experience,</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>179</StartTime>
    <Text>and doing original interviews with people that I knew in my life, and asking them about what they remember about growing up with these experiences, and being able to actually ask follow-up questions.</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>194.5</StartTime>
    <Text>And I'm really grateful to all of the people who have shared their experiences through writing, and who were willing to share their experiences with me,</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>202</StartTime>
    <Text>personally, talking to me into a microphone so that I could refer to it later, which is just a huge leap for someone to take, to talk about their coming-of-age and all those very personal experiences.</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>215</StartTime>
    <Text>But, you know, I couldn't have gone into writing this character with just saying, "Well, I'll just assume that I'll do an OK job and write it however it seems I should,"</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>227</StartTime>
    <Text>and instead saying, "You have to take this seriously and you have to actually reach out to people who have lived it,</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>235</StartTime>
    <Text>so that when you're writing this character it represents the experience of people like her in a way that is plausible and respectful and..."</Text>
  </subtitle>
  <subtitle id="0">
    <StartTime>243</StartTime>
    <Text>Karla: Authentic.
Steve: Yeah. That represents them in a way that doesn't cheapen the experience they've had by relying on cliches or just kind of your expectations as an outsider.</Text>
